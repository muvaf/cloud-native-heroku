# Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD

We would like to deploy our application every time a new commit is pushed. We
will set up ArgoCD to deploy our Helm chart and enable auto-sync so that it
always refreshes when the digest of the chart image changes.

We need to inform ArgoCD about our Helm chart. We will do that by including a
step in our template that will create an ArgoCD `Application` object in our
cluster.

Copy the earlier template.
```bash
cp -a templates/02-image-and-chart templates/03-argocd
```

Change the `metadata` of `template.yaml`
```yaml
metadata:
  name: hello-world-gitops
  title: Hello World with GitOps
```

At the time of writing, I couldn't find an action to be used to create
Kubernetes manifests. The built-in Kubernetes component is used for read-only
operations. So, we will have to write a [custom action][writing-custom-actions] 
to create an ArgoCD `Application` in the cluster that points to our Helm chart.
In addition, we need to have an action to wait for images to be published before
creating the Helm chart.

Since it may take too long, I wrote that custom action before the tutorial as an
NPM package called [`@muvaf/create-argocd-application`][npm-pkg] that we can add to our backend package of Backstage app.

```
# From your Backstage root directory
yarn add --cwd packages/backend @muvaf/create-argocd-application
# To be able to keep using the built-in actions.
yarn add --cwd packages/backend @backstage/integration
```

We will need to register this new custom action in our backend package.
We'll initialize the built-in actions and just append ours.

The content of `packages/backend/src/plugins/scaffolder.ts` should look
like the following:
```typescript
// Content of packages/backend/src/plugins/scaffolder.ts
import { CatalogClient } from '@backstage/catalog-client';
import { createRouter, createBuiltinActions } from '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend';
import { ScmIntegrations } from '@backstage/integration';
import { Router } from 'express';
import type { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
import { argocdCreateHelmApplication, githubWaitLastWorkflow } from "@muvaf/create-argocd-application";

export default async function createPlugin(
  env: PluginEnvironment,
): Promise<Router> {
  const catalogClient = new CatalogClient({ discoveryApi: env.discovery });
  const integrations = ScmIntegrations.fromConfig(env.config);

  const builtInActions = createBuiltinActions({
    integrations,
    catalogClient,
    config: env.config,
    reader: env.reader,
  });

  const actions = [
      ...builtInActions,
      argocdCreateHelmApplication(),
      githubWaitLastWorkflow({ integrations })
  ]

  return await createRouter({
    actions,
    catalogClient,
    logger: env.logger,
    config: env.config,
    database: env.database,
    reader: env.reader,
    identity: env.identity,
  });
}

```

Let's give it a quick try!
```bash
yarn dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/create/actions and scroll down to the bottom to see
if your new custom action appears. If you see it, congrats! ðŸŽ‰


Lastly, we need to give permissions to Backstage to create `Application` in our
namespace.
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: argocd-application-manager
  namespace: heroku
rules:
- apiGroups: ["argoproj.io"]
  resources: ["applications"]
  verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: backstage-argocd
  namespace: heroku
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: backstage
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: argocd-application-manager
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Since we made a code change, we'll need to re-build our app and deploy it to
cluster.
```bash
yarn build
yarn build-image --tag muvaf/backstage-demo:v0.1.0
kind load docker-image muvaf/backstage-demo:v0.1.0
```
```bash
kubectl -n heroku get pods
kubectl -n heroku delete BACKSTAGE_POD_NAME
```

Wait till it terminates successfully and the new one is in `Running` state. Then
forward the port again:
```
kubectl port-forward --namespace=heroku svc/backstage 7007:80
```

The custom actions are there but they're not used by any template. We will edit our
template to contain a step that calls our custom actions. Add the following right
before the last step:
```yaml
# Addition to templates/03-argocd/template.yaml
    - id: github-wait
      name: Wait for Github Actions to complete
      action: github:wait-last-workflow
      input:
        owner: ${{ (parameters.repoUrl | parseRepoUrl).owner }}
        repo: ${{ (parameters.repoUrl | parseRepoUrl).repo }}
        branch: main

    - id: argocd-create
      name: Create ArgoCD Application
      action: argocd:create-helm-application
      input:
        name: ${{ parameters.serviceName }}
        namespace: ${{ parameters.serviceName }}
        chart:
          name: ${{ (parameters.repoUrl | parseRepoUrl).repo }}
          repo: ghcr.io/${{ (parameters.repoUrl | parseRepoUrl).owner }}-chart
          version: 0.1.0
```

Commit your changes and add the path of your new `template.yaml` to our
Backstage app through `Register existing component` button.

Create a new service using our shiny new `Hello World with ArgoCD` template and
you'll see the following happening:
* Git repo created.
* Image and chart are pushed to GHCR.
* ArgoCD fetches the chart and deploys it to your cluster.
* Your application is accessible!

If all things above happened, congratulate yourself! ðŸŽ‰

# Updating the Version

Even though we push to the same image tag, neither Kubernetes will check the
digest of app image nor the ArgoCD will check the digest of the Helm chart
image. So, we'll use a tool called [ArgoCD Image Updater][argocd-image-updater]
to check for a new digest on the tag and update our `Application` resource.

We need to annotate the `Application` resource with an update strategy.
```bash
kubectl -n heroku get applications.argoproj.io
# kubecon-example
```
```bash
kubectl -n heroku annotate applications.argoproj.io kubecon-example argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list='main=ghcr.io/muvaf/kubecon-example:main'
```
```bash
kubectl -n heroku annotate applications.argoproj.io kubecon-example argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/main.update-strategy='digest'
```

Let's make a small change in our hello world code and see if it makes it to our
cluster via ArgoCD!
